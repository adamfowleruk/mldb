# Introduction to MLJS

This course aims to give enough information for pre-sales and consultants to start building demos
rapidly with MLJS.

MLJS gives developers the power to rapidly create compelling demos, PoCs and production applications
using JavaScript and MarkLogic. It's easy to use, with little assumed knowledge of how the internals
of MarkLogic works.

As of 14 Feb 2014 there were 39 widgets in MLJS for use in browser applications. The core API underpinning
all these can also be used from Node.js server applications. This has been used to create situational
awareness applications and Instant Messaging alerting integrations to Jabber.

The MLJS widget API has been used on 10 demonstration and PoC projects in the last 4 months by MarkLogic,
customers and partners. It has been used all over the globe in the UK, USA, France, Germany and Japan.

It has been used to rapidly accelerate application build times. I have built a UI for a complex app
blending 8 data sources, including twitter, and providing 4 different search pages within two days.

## Needed stuff

You'll need to go install Ruby and Roxy. Details are in a video later in this course.

You'll also need to have the MLJS GitHub repo available. You can either clone the whole thing or open
a webpage to download individual files. This is available at:-
