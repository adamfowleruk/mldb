   7. Using MLJS to explore data - Integrated charts, co-occurence, map, query bar
   8. Loading triples with MLJS. How to use a simple JSON structure to load standalone facts.
   9. Configuring an ontology to power Semantic Queries with Sparql. How to customise a sparql query bar widget, and create a subject browsing page
 - New 1.5 (Mar 2014) Interim targets
  - CSS best practice
   - Use variables where it makes sense (title height, padding, etc.)
   - minimise property name length and collisions with other css by using ``.mljswidget .docproperties {  .title {}  .name {} ... }`` style of CSS declarations
   - Rejig H tags to be at a lower level (searchresults h5, subtitle h4, title h3) - leaves space for page title (h1) and panel/tab title (h2), and extra in widget title. E.g. search property value (h6)
   - IN PROGRESS create generic classes for all widgets
    - DONE title
    - subtitle
    - listtitle (E.g. for search results, sparql subjects, other dynamically drawn h4 type tags)
    - highlight
    - selected
  - JavaScript best practices / conventions
   - IN PROGRESS use var max = whatever.length in for loops - between 2 and 150 times faster than accessing the DOM on each iteration
    - DONE Sparql (triple) widgets
    - Search widgets
    - Core
    - Highcharts
   - underscores for private functions
   - NA configuration json object for Workplace compatible widgets/contexts
   - UpperCamelCase for constructors/objects
   - IN PROGRESS lowerCamelCase for functions (searchcontext and mljs have some alllowercase methods)
   - DONE Using Factory pattern. See mljs.create*() methods. Changed mljs.defaultconnection in core MLJS to instead access parent MLJS instance
   - DONE Using logger mixin. Logger's attached to DB, so have had to link tripleconfig to creating db via factory method. keep tripleconfig separate from core MLJS instantiator (as it never requires a connection to use), but allow a way to specify a logger and check for this (to avoid defaultconnection.logger)
   - DONE better way to access logging functionality by default - define i(), d() prototype methods for each subobject? Via a core mixin utility func?
    - DONE (Could use same mechanism to provide correct 'this' reference from constructor function.)
    - DONE Using mljs.create*() factory methods. Have mljs.prototype. constructor functions add a db property pointer to all created children
   - NA Using factory pattern instead. Add check in constructor functions to ensure if not called via new MyObject(), that it returns a new instance anyway (location 1051)
   - Double check isArray function definition for best practice (location 1110) - also check for splice()
   - IN PROGRESS Done this for tripleconfig, not widgets and their contexts. Use self defining functions for lazy loading (E.g. semantic context creation), and any requiring extensive initialisation (Sparql widget?) (location 1515)
   - Memoization (cache) pattern applied to sparql facts (location 1702)
   - Apply Currying when calling the same function with mostly same parameters (if costly) (location 1860)
   - Use Module pattern and closures to hide internal properties/private methods (location 2117) but with constructors (2139)
   - DONE using for logging mixin on context objects. Apply Borrow and Bind pattern (mixin for functions) where applicable (to avoid any inheritance temptations) (location 2922)
   - Apply Data Validation pattern to 'create' widget (When new functionality added - may be V 1.2?) (location 3254)
   - Find a better way to restrict what parts of the logging output are set to use debug (Perhaps a mixin to objects with lazy initialisation based on debug level specified, if any)

   - DONE Check for 'innerHTML += ' and replace with appendChild and temporary div trick
   - Perform JavaScript profiling in FireBug (again) to check for issues

   - Core: Score-function=linear|reciprocal, scale-factor=0|inputFloat

  - IN PROGRESS Defines what pages are available, the layout of those pages, and what is shown on each

  - Load application wide Workplace configuration settings (Not just content DB wide - use domain name somehow)
  - IN PROGRESS Widget initialisation for each page done dynamically
   - NA (For first version require all to be on import path) Requires dynamic loading of scripts, or importing of all scripts (do latter for now)

  - Implying triples from document content
   - define a trigger to highlight key XML with known terms
   - link these xml elements to the ontology via the suggestions widget
  - Inferencing
   - Start with a query for which you have the data, but which creating a sparql query is non trivial
   - Use inferencing as a way to suggest triples that would make the query simpler
   - Show the new query, and that the same answers are produced
  - Avoiding sparql/xquery inferencing
   - Is there a navigation process possible via existing widgets that would allow you to discover all related subjects and information you need, and produce a report off of the back of it?
   - Embed BI type summaries too? (E.g. facet graphs from document query results)
  - Sparql 1.1 in MarkLogic 7
   - Show what parts of the spec are there, and which ones we're missing, but which ones *can* be provided with a little work
   - Inferencing - we've shown, but should mention here

 - DONE Widgets: Address to Lon Lat - Perform address lookup for top matching point, feed as constraint in to structured query
  - DONE Google address lookup
   - NOT A BUG wasn't using same searchcontext - need to change setContext to setSearchContext globally - contributing multiple terms only processes last term in search
  - DONE BUG heatmap doesn't clear when zero results returned from next search

     - Fix chart search page
   - DONE Docs: Rework cooccurence example to use search context, and contributeStructureQuery
   - NA Not possible. Close approximation without grammar with term queries though: Check if structured query supports dynamic text query constraints with grammar (i.e. one term with grammar parsing)
   - DEFERRED Do shadow query automatically in searchcontext rather than per-widget?
   - DEFERRED Come up with a strategy for parent-child relationships in search widgets (one way facet selection - E.g. genre THEN album)
   - NA alter the options to fetch data. Use updateResults to retrieve them for display: Allow widgets to request information in results, rather than alter search options (E.g. request a heatmap, or particular metadata properties) - context updates options on the fly

    - TEST Save changes to layout configuration on drop
    - TEST Add html moving code, preserving event handlers
